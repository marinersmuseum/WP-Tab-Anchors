WP-Tab-Anchors
==============

This WordPress plugin allows you to permalink (i.e., bookmark) to content on Twitter Bootstrap tabs via hash tag links.

Out-of-the-box, Bootstrap won't allow you to permalink to content on inactive tabs. This plugin activates the tab containing the permalinked content and then scrolls the page to the hash tag (i.e., to the HTML element with the ID specified in the hash tag). You don't even have to know which tab the content is on; the plugin figures it out. It does this so quick you really won't notice all this going on. Page visitors who arrive using your permalink will pretty much immediately see the content you permalinked.

The now defunct jQuery BBQ and successor History.js (made for HTML5) could be made to do this better, but I like my plugin because I (and I'm sure others) have an affinity for hash tag links; they just look old-school.
